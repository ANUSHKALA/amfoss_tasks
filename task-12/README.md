To be honest, before this task I had'nt known anything about blocks or blockchains so when I searched about them and learned in detail about them I was very fascinated that such a simple but effective structure of code could be used to deal with something as big as bitcoin.

I even expplained it to some of my friends and even the found it interesting.

I am glad that this was one of the tasks so I got to learn about something as amazing as this:)
