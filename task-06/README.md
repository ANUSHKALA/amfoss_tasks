The most time I spent on a task is this one.
Maybe if I had started with dart i could have done it earlier and more easily.

At first, I tried to build the ui in java and all the tries had some or the other bugs.
They didnt load at all.


But then I read the task name and realised -_- that this was supposed to be a FLUTTER BASED UI.

It was devastating that I could make such a blunder mistake. Anyways I attached those files as well.

Then I tried to do it with dart and it did'nt work in the first try, so I tried one last time.

At the end I am glad that this worked.
I had actually lost hope that i could ever do this task, but then the seniors and my friends also helped me, so I was at last able to complete it:)
