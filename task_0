Installing ubuntu is an easy task if done after proper information.
In my case, I tried dual booting for about 5 times only to return to a black screen with a blinking underscore each time.
I asked my seniors for help and they were always ready to help and suggested me to watch videos on dual booting on hp pcs only. It did help.
At last I did find a video that helped me throughout and I successfully dual booted and installed Ubuntu on my pc
