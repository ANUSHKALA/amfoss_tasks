<h1>Why must we chose you?</h1>
<p>I am persistant and try to do my best. I always feel excited if the code that I wrote works. So it never gets boring. And I always try to gain as much as I can,  so I think that I can be helpful in the club and will work hard. </p>

<h1>What is your plan for the next 6 months?</h1>
<p>I want to try my best, learn new things whether in club activities or academics and want to become a part of amFOSS. And try to be a better version of myself. Become capable of managing my time between academics and club activities. And do what I do wholeheartedly.</p>

<h1>How will you contribute back to the club?</h1>
<p>I want to give my best by completing the tasks and projects I get from the club if I am selected. Try to contribute to open source. Try to share the knowledge that I gain from my experiences in the future.</p>

<h1>Do you have any feedback of the selection process?</h1>
<p>In my opinion the selection process is pretty effective. There were things that I had never heard of and tried for the first time in my life. Some attempts were successful some were not, some tasks took very long time, I also lost hope in some tasks but the seniors always helped so I tried as much as I could with their help and atlast could complete 10 tasks. Basically, it pushed my limits and even if I don't get selected I will always feel a sense of accomplishment that I got from doing the tasks. On the other hand it really seperated the people who sincerely want to be in the club to those who dont.</p>
