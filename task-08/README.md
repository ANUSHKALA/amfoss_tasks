I did study HTML in my 8th standard so I kinda thouht that atleast this task I could pull off without much difficulty but I eventually realised that it required much more knowledge that what I had originally known.

It was a good task.

Although I did a lot of mistakes and googled literally everything I did get to learn a lot from this task. It might not be the perfect one but it passes the basic requirements.

It was a good experience and the seniors helped a lot as well.
